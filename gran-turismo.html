            <h2>Gran Turismo</h2>
            <p>
              Jann is an avid gamer from Cardiff who spends his days playing
              Gran Turismo, refusing to succeed in the real world. Meanwhile, in
              Tokyo, Danny, a marketing manager for the Nissan automobile
              corporation, is running an advertising campaign and, together with
              the management of Gran Turismo, hatches a plan to launch a
              competition inviting gamers to try their luck in real racing cars.
              Needing help organizing an event, Danny turns to Jack, a former
              racing driver and incorrigible cynic. When fate brings Jann
              together with Danny and Jack, the gamer becomes the driver of a
              Nissan racing car, plunging headlong into the fight for a place in
              the sun in the competitive world of real racing.

              This is the most iconic car in the film. It's the vehicle that
              Jann Mardenborough uses throughout his time in the GT Academy and
              as a professional racer. Its presence is directly tied to the
              film's premise, as the GT Academy was a real-world program created
              by Nissan to turn gamers into racers. The GT-R is the car that
              takes him from the digital world to the track, and it's the one he
              drives to victory in key races.

              This is the car that Jann drives with his team at the climax of
              the movie, the 24 Hours of Le Mans. It is a highly advanced Le
              Mans Prototype (LMP) car that represents the ultimate goal of his
              racing career. It is the final vehicle that Jann pilots to achieve
              his dreams, making it one of the most memorable and important cars
              in the film.

            <p>
              The 370Z, along with other vehicles like the Caterham, was used to
              teach the GT Academy finalists the basics of real-world track
              racing at Silverstone. It was the first "real" race car that the
              gamers drove, marking their transition from a video game simulator
              to an actual motorsport setting.
