              Under the alias, "Brian Earl Spilner", Brian O'Conner used the
              Eclipse in preparation for his first street race. He practices
              driving in the Eclipse at the parking lot at Dodger Stadium, but
              can't keep the car from spinning out of control. Despite
              complications experienced earlier, Brian decided to participate in
              the street race to win the favor of Dominic Toretto.

              On a Dodge Charger, "R/T" stands for "Road and Track". The 1970
              Dodge Charger R/T was kept inside the garage of the Toretto House,
              was built by Dominic and his father in his youth. When his father
              was killed in a stock race accident by Kenny Linder, Dominic
              refused to drive the Charger because he was afraid of it. Later he
              used this to chase down the person who killed Jesse, a part of his
              crew

              A fan favorite, the Toyota Supra is so fast it's able to smoke a
              Ferrari in a street race. Towards the end of the movie Brian and
              Mia Toretto use the Supra to rescue Vince from the semi-truck.
              Brian later uses the Supra to chase down Johnny Tran and his
              cousin Lance through the suburbs of Los Angeles when they do a
              drive by at 1327, killing Jesse.
